# Punk_Graph

looking to build a music graph based on people. Would like to start with punk people and see were it goes and can be displayed and filtered in an easy to see website.

Update this google doc with 
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Os4D51g11FFn6uJ_cjhLCdaxZAmx9RtC__ckaHYYKgs/edit?usp=sharing

# example on how the sheet looks and is to be filled out.

|---|---|---|---|
|Travis Barker |	PLAYED |	IN |	BLINK 182
|Travis Barker |	PRODUCED |	FOR |	Avril Lavign

If there are more JOB's or ACTIONs to add open a new issue [here](https://github.com/Jelenbl/Punk_Graph/issues/new)
